Pyrender Documentation
========================
Pyrender is a pure Python (2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6) library for physically-based
rendering and visualization.
It is designed to meet the glTF 2.0 specification_ from Khronos

.. _specification: https://www.khronos.org/gltf/

Pyrender is lightweight, easy to install, and simple to use.
It comes packaged with both an intuitive scene viewer and a headache-free
offscreen renderer with support for GPU-accelerated rendering on headless
servers, which makes it perfect for machine learning applications.
Check out the :ref:`guide` for a full tutorial, or fork me on
Github_.
